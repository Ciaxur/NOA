# NOA.js (Pre-Alpha v0.0.5)

A team project to create an Electron.js Based Messenger that can run locally on any machine. 
A Messenger that can connect securely with encryption to allow for true privacy. 
This project is **NOT** yet complete, so all the features such as Encryption, is **NOT** 
yet implemented. 

Project is **NOT** yet complete, however the functionality works so far. No Security is 
implemented **YET**. Communication works with packets and chat history appending. 
Still needs a ton more polishing.
